                It is popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. As a Georgian staple food
                the price of making khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities
                by the "khachapuri index", developed by the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State
                University.[2][3] It is Georgia's national dish, included in the list of the intangible
                cultural heritage of Georgia.[4][5] On the behalf and initiative of the Gastronomic
                ssociation of Georgia, the 27th of February was announced as National Khachapuri Day,
                to celebrate Georgia's signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition
                internationally. The khachapuri is served hot from the oven, otherwise it loses 
                the taste of its unique cheese mixture and becomes bitter.

                Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety
                of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants,
                via delivery, and as street food.[9] In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented
                unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however,
                it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold
                in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly.
                 Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.
                In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12] Overall13ofthe US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13]
